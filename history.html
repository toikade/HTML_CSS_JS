		<h1>Our Story.</h1>
			<p>Well our history.. where should i start.. You won't believe me
			if I told you. Ok! I'll try. Go outside and look at the Sun. If you saw
			it, well.. we're older than the sun you saw. So trust us.</p><hr/>
			<p>It all started like a joke when I was very hungry and had to eat,
			so I began searching for food in this deserted land until i stumbled
			upon this <q>deliciosus steakus</q>,(well.. I think that's the scientific
			name), it was one of a kind and I think it should have been the only
			one perhaps still living. To cut the long story short, the steakus did
			not particularly prove easy to capture using conventional ways at that
			time so i had to resort to science to help me out. Since that day I 
			vowed to discover tools to help me out on this and all those tools 
			have been used by others in their daily tasks. Although till this day 
			I have not yet captured the steakus, my genius team and I and always
			on the watch for new discoveries.<hr/> 
			<blockquote class="quote">"We came to discover recently that our genius 
			tools are not particularly fit for and kind with geniuses. They frequently
			backfire with geniuses, so use at your risk"</blockquote></p>
